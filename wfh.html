<h2 id="wfh-policies"><a href="#wfh-policies">Work From Home</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>
You-Source grants privileges to its employees from temporary working offsite but still linked electronically. This is an agreed set up of the employee and immediate superior where the employee is still required to perform work during core hours. As this is not considered permanent, both parties are in agreement that circumstances may arise, adjustments and modifications may become necessary.
</li>

<li>
Team members availing Work From Home MUST ensure that:

<ul>
<li>They have a stable internet connection to perform work properly;</li>
<li>They have the proper computer equipment necessary (laptop, desktop, mic and headset, etc.)</li>
<li>
If the team member cannot provide the following basic necessary infrastructure for work, then they are NOT allowed to work from home, and will be considered absent.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Team members can be granted to <strong>work from home</strong> on the following conditions:
<ol>
  <li>
  <strong>UNPLANNED WFH</strong> - these are scenarios when unexpected events happen beyond the control of the team member. Only the following scenarios are work from home allowed without prior coordination with the team lead:

    <ol>
    <li>Occurrence of natural calamities (fire, typhoon, earthquake);</li>
    <li>Look after an immediate family member who may be sick or attend to needs;</li>
    <li>Health Conditions that requires home rest or are immobilized due to an accident (supported by medical findings and recommendations);</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>PLANNED WFH</strong> - these are scenarios wherein such usage of the work from home privilege has been properly planned and coordinated with the team lead:
  <ol>
    <li>
    Each team members have 5 Work From Home credits per year, replenishing in co-terminus with vacation leaves and sick leaves;
    </li>
    <li>
    The team member has the privilege to use such credits provided that he/she coordinated 2 working days in advance with the team lead;
    </li>
    <li>
    As much as reasonably possible, everyone, including the team lead and with proper coordination with the client, will respect the planned WFH schedule. This implies that, once planned, the schedule may not be revoked or transferred unless with the full consent of the team member;
    </li>
    <li>
  the 5 Work From Home credits may be used consecutively;
    </li>
  </ol>
  </li>

</li>

<li>
The team member will send an email request to immediate superior stating the reason and duration.
  <ol>
    <li>
    The team member MUST seek approval to their team leads whether their work from home request has merit or not. The reason is to prevent abuse of the system, or to avoid scheduling problems (e.g. there is an important meeting that the person need to attend in person, all other people are absent, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
    Should his work from home request be denied for objective and valid reasons, the team member should then provide a way to go to the office.
    </li>
    <li>
    Failure to go to the office in this instance will be dealt with as per process below.
    </li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>
Approved work from home request will be forwarded to HR for timekeeping purposes. This will then be the responsibility of the team lead.
</li>

<li>
The team member MUST be contactable, via Skype and/or other means, by other team members and their team lead from the start of work hour. This is to resolve questions regarding code, to answer queries regarding their work, or to give status of tasks, among others.
</li>

<li>
The team member must attend all scheduled meetings with the client while on Work From Home. Working from home does NOT give us the privilege to deliver less than the client deserves. In fact, it should allow us to deliver more because, in theory, we have removed transportation hours away.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="not-granted"><a href="#not-granted">What happens when my WFH request has not been granted?</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>
It will then be considered as a 1-day Vacation Leave. The team member need not work anymore, as all the rules applying to vacation leave applies.
</li>
<li>
If the team member has run out of Vacation Leave, it will then be filed as Leave Without Pay, and all rules applying to Leave Without Pay applies.
</li>
<li>
In this case, we may not use Sick Leave, as per HR policy SL is not convertible to VL, and vice-versa. SL is reserved if you are indeed sick.
</li>
</ol>
